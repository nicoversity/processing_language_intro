# A very brief introduction to Processing programming language in preparation to creative coding using Processing
The purpose of this project is to provide a very brief introduction to the Processing programming language. Through a series of stages, fundamental concepts of Processing are illustrated and described.

The project was created as part of an overall introduction to creative coding using [Processing](https://processing.org).

## Project walkthrough
Following a summarized project walkthrough is given, illustrating the single stages of this introduction to Processing. Each step of the walkthrough describes the content of the corresponding Processing sketch.

### 01 - Processing function base frame
Illustrating the base frame of a *function* in Processing. The function features a simple print out of some text to the *console*. Furthermore the *syntax* of a function in Processing is described.

### 02 - Statements
Describing different statements in Processing, such as *declaration* statement, *assignment* statement, *output* statement and *return* statement. Furthermore the terminology of *initialization* and *left-hand side (LHS)* as well as *right-hand side (RHS)* are introduced.

### 03 - Arithmetic operators
Five different *arithmetic operators*, concretely +, -, * , / and % (modulo) are introduced.

### 04 - More functions and local vs global variables/scope
Functions to *add* and *multiply* two variables are created and called. Furthermore, the difference between *local* and *global variables* and their accessibility is illustrated.

### 05 - Arrays
During this step, the concept and manipulation of *arrays* is illustrated.

### 06 - Loops and iteration
Functionalities in order to iterate and thus execute source code over and over again are illustrated in form of the *for-loop*, the *while-loop*, and the *do-while-loop*. Additionally, an example for the *iteration over an array* collection is demonstrated.

### 07 - Branching source code using conditional statements
Using the *if-else statement*, the *switch-statement* as well as the *conditional operator*, different possibilities to branch source code are illustrated, helping the user to react on dynamic conditions directly.

### 08 - Relational and logical operators
During this step, common *relational* (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) and *logical* (&&, ||, !) *operators* in Processing are introduced in order to use the full potential of the prior described approaches to create branches in the source code.
